## **Step 2: Check the Streamlit Cloud Terminal for Specific Error**

1. In Streamlit Cloud, click **"Manage app"** (bottom right)
2. Look at the **terminal/logs** section
3. Scroll down to see the error message

### **Common errors you might see:**

**Error A: "No module named 'plotly.express'"**
- This is actually fine - plotly.express is included in plotly

**Error B: "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement"**
- Try updating requirements.txt to specify versions

**Error C: "FileNotFoundError: synthetic_claims_data.csv"**
- Your CSV file is missing from GitHub

## **Step 3: Most Likely Fix - Update requirements.txt with Specific Versions**

Replace your current `requirements.txt` with this version that includes specific, stable versions:
```
streamlit==1.28.0
pandas==2.0.3
plotly==5.17.0
